1.we will learn about the difference between two leading web frameworks Django and Laravel.
We will make a very detailed comparison of both technologies and learn which framework
is more suitable. We will also explore the advantages and disadvantages of both frameworks.

We assume that you have already familiar with what the framework is. If you don't,
below is a brief description of the web framework.

Frameworks are software abstractions. They consist of pre-written libraries and complex code
already. So using the framework, we don't need to understand the complex code and queries,
and we can skip the hassle of developing low-level infrastructure.

2.Django vs. Laravel:

For example - To operate the TV, we don't need to learn about its picture-tube or
how visuals are reflected on the screen. Instead, we only need a remote to control the television.

3.What is Django?

Django is a high-level web framework that is written in Python. It was released in 2005
and developed by the Django Software Foundation.

This framework is battery-included and used for developing rich applications.
It follows the MVT architecture for rapid web development. Many technology giants
such as Mozilla, Instagram, Bitbucket, Pinterest, etc., are using the Django framework.

It comes with the built-in database support SQLite. The primary aim of the Django
framework is to provide a fast development environment, which helps developers
create an application in a shorter period.

4.Key Features of Django:

Below are the useful features of django.

1. Excellent Documentation

It is one of the best features of Django, which motivates to learn it. It offers
the best documentation as compared to other available technologies. As a result,
users can easily find the solution of their problems. It also helps to utilize the technology.

2. SEO-Optimized

SEO stands for search engine optimization which is a unique feature of django.
It helps to adding web pages on the top results. Search engines like Google uses
some algorithm which sometimes doesn't cooperate much with the developer. Django
maintains the websites through the URLs rather than the IP addresses on the server.
It reduces the headache of developer where he/she don't need to convert the URL in numeric code.

3. High Scalability

Django is used worldwide, and it gets implemented without any errors. Scalability
is a term that defines at what level technology gets implemented. For example,
one of the leading social media platforms, Instagram, used Django. Instagram has
millions of users, and it generates a huge amount of data. Django provides a system
that can handle complex data without any system failure.

4. High Security

Django gets popular because it is highly secure. It is secure because it covers
the loopholes which were not automatically done in other frameworks. We can prove
that a lot of websites used Django and generates a vast amount of traffic.

5. Provides Rapid Development

Rapid development means the developer doesn't need to know about the backend details
to make a fully functioning website. It cuts off the complex coding to build something
from scratch. Django provides the built-in admin panel, so we don't need to make it
from scratch, and it also provides the built-in support of SQLite. So we don't need to
write typical SQL queries. Instead, we can use the Django models.

6.What is Laravel?

Laravel is a PHP-written, open-source framework that handles server-side processes
such as HTML authentication, templating, routing, and more.

Taylor Otwell developed it, and it is based on Symfony that provides reusable
PHP components/libraries. Laravel provides the facility to develop a completely
functional website with customized backend logic. Some excellent projects, such as
Swat.io, Rozerpay, Packet, 9GAG, etc., are written in Laravel. As a result, it has
gained much popularity among developers.

7.Key Features of Laravel:

Below are the important features of Laravel.

7.1.Pre-packaged tools:

It provides the ready-to-use packages for user authentication and offers tools to
perform common tasks such as routing, HTML rendering, testing APIs.

7.2.Template Engine:

Laravel is popular for its built-in lightweight templates which are quite helpful
to create attractive, dynamic layout. It offers the multiple widgets along with the
JS and CSS code with the robust structure.

7.3.MVS Architecture Support:

Laravel follows the MVC (Model View Controller) which is responsible for distinguish
business logic and presentation layers. MVC pattern of Laravel comes with the lots
of built-in methods. These methods enhance the application performance and increases securities as well.

7.4.Security:

Laravel framework offers high security. It uses hashed and salted password mechanism so
that password is saved as hash in the database. Moreover, Bcypt Hashing Algorithm is used
for generating an encrypted password.

8.Difference between Django and Laravel:

We have discussed the essential details about both frameworks and seen their essential
features them. Now we will discuss the important difference. The following are the difference
between Django and Laravel on various parameters.

Parameter	                        Django	                               Laravel
Programming Languages	    A Django is an open-source,
                            battery-included web framework written
                            in Python programming language.	            A Laravel is a full stack,
                                                                        open-source web framework written
                                                                        in the PHP programming language.

Code	                Django code is slightly complex as compare      Laravel code is not much difficult as Django
                        to Laravel because it uses the regular          Beginners can get its syntax easily.

                                                                        Example - <? php Route:get('/', function()
                                                                        { return view('posts.index'); });
                                                                        Route:get('/posts/create', function()
                                                                        { return view('posts.create'); }); ?>
                        Example - urlptterns = [                         .
                        #ex: /polls/
                        path('', view.index, name='index'),
                        #ex: /polls/5/
                        path('', view.detail, name='detail'),
                        #ex: /polls/5/results/
                        ]


Scalability	        Django can handle enormous
                    traffic flawlessly.                                 It works effortlessly with the various
                                                                        technologies while maintaining the lowest
                                                                        loading times. Moreover, it optimizes
                                                                        elements like images, CSS, HTML, etc.,
                                                                        and balance the load with the other resources.
                                                                        Some of the popular projects are developed using Laravel.
                                                                        Laravel applications can be scaled up without any
                                                                        limitations. Being written in PHP, it provides
                                                                        support to rapidly growing businesses. A good
                                                                        Database and load balancer, we can make the Laravel highly scalable.


Architecture	    It supports the MVT model which
                    is known as Model View Template.	                It works on the MVC model which is known
                                                                        as Model View Controller.

Community	        It is maintained by the Django
                    Software Foundation and has a large
                    base developer community. Apart from
                    that, it provides excellent packages,
                    easy to learn environment.	                    It also has a vast community of
                                                                    developers. It provides the dependency
                                                                    injection, application architecture,
                                                                    and good community package.

Generality	        It provides rapid development features
                    which automate the essential processes.	        It has clean architecture and growing
                                                                    community base.

Development
Environment     	Django provides a lightweight web server
                    with easier and faster development.             It makes the end to end development
                                                                    and testing activities easier.
                                                                    Laravel framework embraces Queues and event
                                                                    & command bus, which is used to run the cron jobs.


Compatibility	    Many popular frameworks do exist for Python.    PHP is only considered a framework
                                                                    for PHP.

Performance         Django is much faster than Laravel.
                    For example, in the 2018 JSON serialization test,
                    Django performed 69k JSON responses in a second.	Laravel is far behind in terms of
                                                                        speed. In the same test, it performed
                                                                        an 8k response/second. So in terms
                                                                        of speed, Laravel lose the battle.

Security	        Django implements some best security measurement
                    which avoids common mistakes of web development.    Leading space agency NASA uses Django
                                                                        for their websites.	It provides the
                                                                        basics of security interface, but it
                                                                        doesn't live up to the Django security
                                                                        level.

API	                Django doesn't come with built-in support
                    for API. Developer needs to include libraries
                    to build APIs.	                                    Laravel comes with built-in API support.
                                                                        Therefore, we don't need to include any other
                                                                        library to create RESTAPI.

8.Some Other Important Differences:
