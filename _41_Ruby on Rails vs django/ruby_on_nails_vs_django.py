1.Ruby on Rails and Django are two leading web frameworks popularly used in web development.

These frameworks share lots of similarities, but each has unique features on its way.
Both are written in the dynamic programming language and are object-oriented.

Certainly, the best way to choose is according to the project environment and
how they can meet the features of each software.

2.What is Ruby on Rails?

Ruby and Rail is an open-source web framework written on the Ruby programming
language under MIT license. The first version was released 16 years ago.
The latest version is Rails 6.0.3.4, which was released on 7 October 2020.
It is a server-side framework that follows the MVC (Model View Controller).

Ruby on rails is popular of its "convention over configuration," which means that
Rails provide many defaults features that we can modify later. For example,
it decides the folder structure automatically (where to put your controller or view template).

Ruby on Rails also provides some excellent integration for scheduling background
jobs (Active job), an ORM (Object Relationship Mapper), a wrapper for sending
e-mails (ActionMaker). It also comes with the file stores (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage,
and others) called ActiveStorage.

Despite having many defaults for database, web service, and file storage,
we don't need to go through each step.

3.Advantages of Ruby and Rails:

Ruby on Rails is a quality, scalable, secure, and popular web development framework.
It provides many features that make it famous among developers. The following are
the advantages of Ruby on Rails.

Ruby on Rails is a quality, scalable, secure, and popular web development framework.
It provides many features that make it famous among developers. The following are
the advantages of Ruby on Rails.

Cost Effective

Ruby on Rails is an open-source framework means 100% free and runs on Linux which
is also an open-source framework. There are many features available, so developers
don't need to write complex code and it save the plenty of developers' time.

We can create great quality website easily without spending hard earned money.

Built on Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture

A web application has three interconnected layers of architecture. The developers
write the code that work on the application data. It centralizes the business
logic of the application and the rules to manipulate the data. It includes HTML,
PDF, XML, RSS, and other formats. The controller acts as bridge between models and views.

Secure

Ruby on Rail follows the secure development lifecycle, and some security measures
are built within the framework. It has a huge community that is actively working
to spot and patch new vulnerabilities.

Performance

It provides excellent performance, and it optimizes the code very efficiently.
A web application can have lots of computation or data handling so that Rails
could slow down the application. However, an effective code optimization technique
can make the application smooth.

Flexibility

Web applications use the frontend and backend capabilities of Rails. We can create
easily, but the application needs to communicate to the server to load the web page.

Large Community

It has a vast community worldwide, and it is one of the most popular programming
languages on Github. The community is head toward improving code and serving
others on their projects.

If you are stuck anywhere while coding, you can find the solution over the forum.
There is a chance someone else has already built something similar before or is
willing to help you fix any issue.

4.Disadvantages of Ruby on Rails:

Every coin has two sides. Along with some excellent advantages Ruby on Rails
also comes with the few demerits. Below are some important disadvantages that
you should keep in mind while choosing it for your project.

Run Time Speed and Performance

It is the most frequent argument against Ruby on Rails. The other frameworks
(nodes and Django) are indeed faster than the RoR. It is a slow runtime speed,
which makes them harder to scale web applications.

Huge cost of wrong decision in development

If we choose the wrong architecture during the initial stage of the project,
we might cost more in Rails than in another framework. An inexperienced team
might make unobvious mistakes that will erode our application's application.
In RoR, all components are tightly coupled and depend on each other.

Hard to create APIs

It might be problematic to create APIs with Ruby on Rails. It has varying
quality and standard of documentation and a slow runtime speed. There is also a
lack of structured information so that users won't find the solution of complex problem

Lack of Proper Documentation

Ruby on Rails doesn't have proper documentation. Good documentation plays an
excellent role in finding a common solution. Since reading the documentation is
not necessary for experienced developers, they need to study the code.

5.What is Django?

Django is a high-level web framework that is written in Python. It was released
in 2005 and developed by the Django Software Foundation.

This framework is battery-included and used for developing rich applications.
It follows the MVT
architecture for rapid web development. Many technology giants such as Mozilla,
Instagram, Bitbucket, Pinterest, etc., are using the Django framework.

It comes with the built-in database support SQLite

. The primary aim of the Django is to provide a fast development environment,
which helps developers create an application in a shorter period

6.Advantages of Django:

Django is the most popular framework nowadays because of its excellent advantages.
Below are some interesting advantages of Django.

Provides Rapid Development

Rapid development means the developer doesn't need to know about the backend
details to make a fully functioning website. It cuts off the complex coding to
build something from scratch. Django provides the built-in admin panel, so we
don't need to make it from scratch, and it also provides the built-in support
of SQLite. So we don't need to write typical SQL queries. Instead, we can use the Django models.

Excellent Documentation

It is one of the best features of Django, which motivates to learn it. It offers
the best documentation as compared to other available technologies. As a result,
users can easily find the solution of their problems. It also helps to utilize the technology.

SEO Optimized

SEO (Search engine optimization) is key factor in website ranking. Django comes
with the SEO optimize feature that helps to make the web pages browser and user friendly.

High Scalability
Scalability term refers to what level of technology gets implemented. Many
tech giants use Django. A famous photo-sharing platform Instagram uses Django.
Django provides a system that can handle complex data without any system failure.

7.Disadvantages of Django:

Despite being written in Python, Django has some disadvantages. Let's understand
the following demerits of Django.

ORM system lacks features

Django ORM provides the facility to work with the several databases and perform
queries in pythonic way. But it lacks some essential features, which are available
in the other ORM systems.

Components are depended on each other

Most web framework keeps their component loosely coupled so that developer can
modify independently. Unfortunately, components are tightly coupled in Django
that force developers to install all of them simultaneously.

Bad at handling multiple requests at same time

As we know, Django is a trending and modern framework, but it cannot handle the
multiple requests at the same time. Many frameworks including Java combines these
processes to cut down development time.


7.Difference between Ruby on Rails and Django:

Below are the main difference between Django and RoR.

Speed and Performance	RoR is slightly faster than Django because
                        it has the advantage of a rich repository of
                        excellent libraries.	                             Django Rest Framework provides the

Stability	            RoR provides a convenient approach for the
                        reuse of code and minimizes the dependencies.	    Django practices a more conventional
                                                                            approach by sticking to any proven method.

Syntax	                RoR's syntax is much flexible as compared to
                        Django, and sometimes it can create problems
                        and make it harder to pass a project to
                        other team.	                                        Its syntax is easy to read and debug.

Documentation
of Framework	        Documentation of Ruby on Rails is less
                        effective than Django.	                            Django comes with detailed and well-structured
                                                                            documentation. Anyone learn Django's concept
